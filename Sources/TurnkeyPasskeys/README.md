# TurnkeyPasskeys

This Swift package provides a high-level interface for passkey-based authentication using Apple's `AuthenticationServices` framework. It handles both registration and assertion flows, making it easy to integrate passkeys into your app.

It is designed to work with Turnkeyâ€™s backend services, specifically for generating and verifying passkey credentials.

## Features

* Simple `createPasskey()` function to register a new passkey.
* `PasskeyStamper` class to assert (authenticate) using an existing passkey.
* Support for platform authenticators (e.g., Face ID / Touch ID) and security keys (e.g., YubiKey).

## Requirements

* iOS 16.0+ / macOS 13.0+
* Swift 5.7+

## Usage

### Create a new passkey

```swift
import TurnkeyPasskeys

let registration = try await createPasskey(
    user: PasskeyUser(
        id: UUID().uuidString,
        name: "Anonymous User",
        displayName: "Anonymous User"
    ),
    rp: RelyingParty(
        id: Constants.App.rpId,
        name: Constants.App.appName
    ),
    presentationAnchor: anchor
)
```

This returns the attestation data and challenge needed to create a user or authenticator on the Turnkey platform.

### Authenticate with an existing passkey

```swift
import TurnkeyPasskeys

let stamper = PasskeyStamper(
    rpId: Constants.App.rpId,
    presentationAnchor: anchor
)
```

Use the result to sign payloads or authenticate a session.
