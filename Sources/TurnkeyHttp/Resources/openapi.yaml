  description: |-
    An Organization is the highest level of hierarchy in Turnkey. It can contain many Users, Private Keys, and Policies managed by a Root Quorum. The Root Quorum consists of a set of Users with a consensus threshold. This consensus threshold must be reached by Quorum members in order for any actions to take place.

    See [Root Quorum](../concepts/users/root-quorum) for more information
- name: Invitations
  description: |-
    Invitations allow you to invite Users into your Organization via email. Alternatively, Users can be added directly without an Invitation if their ApiKey or Authenticator credentials are known ahead of time.

    See [Users](./api#tag/Users) for more information
- name: Policies
  description: |-
    Policies allow for deep customization of the security of your Organization. They can be used to grant permissions or restrict usage of Users and Private Keys. The Policy Engine analyzes all of your Policies on each request to determine whether an Activity is allowed.

    See [Policy Overview](../managing-policies/overview) for more information
- name: Wallets
  description: |-
    Wallets contain collections of deterministically generated cryptographic public / private key pairs that share a common seed. Turnkey securely holds the common seed, but only you can access it. In most cases, Wallets should be preferred over Private Keys since they can be represented by a mnemonic phrase, used across a variety of cryptographic curves, and can derive many addresses.

    Derived addresses can be used to create digital signatures using the corresponding underlying private key. See [Signing](./api#tag/Signing) for more information
- name: Signing
  description: "Signers allow you to create digital signatures. Signatures are used\
    \ to validate the authenticity and integrity of a digital message. Turnkey makes\
    \ it easy to produce signatures by allowing you to sign with an address. If Turnkey\
    \ doesn't yet support an address format you need, you can generate and sign with\
    \ the public key instead by using the address format `ADDRESS_FORMAT_COMPRESSED`."
- name: Private Keys
  description: |-
    Private Keys are cryptographic public / private key pairs that can be used for cryptocurrency needs or more generalized encryption. Turnkey securely holds all private key materials for you, but only you can access them.

    The Private Key ID or any derived address can be used to create digital signatures. See [Signing](./api#tag/Signing) for more information
- name: Private Key Tags
  description: Private Key Tags allow you to easily group and permission Private Keys
    through Policies.
- name: Users
  description: "Users are responsible for any action taken within an Organization.\
    \ They can have ApiKey or Auuthenticator credentials, allowing you to onboard\
    \ teammates to the Organization, or create API-only Users to run as part of your\
    \ infrastructure."
- name: User Tags
  description: User Key Tags allow you to easily group and permission Users through
    Policies.
- name: Authenticators
  description: "Authenticators are WebAuthN hardware devices, such as a Macbook TouchID\
    \ or Yubikey, that can be used to authenticate requests."
- name: API Keys
  description: |-
    API Keys are used to authenticate requests

    See our [CLI](https://github.com/tkhq/tkcli) for instructions on generating API Keys
- name: Activities
  description: |-
    Activities encapsulate all the possible actions that can be taken with Turnkey. Some examples include adding a new user, creating a private key, and signing a transaction.

    Activities that modify your Organization are processed asynchronously. To confirm processing is complete and retrieve the Activity results, these activities must be polled until that status has been updated to a finalized state: `COMPLETED` when the activity is successful or `FAILED` when the activity has failed
- name: Consensus
  description: |-
    Policies can enforce consensus requirements for Activities. For example, adding a new user requires two admins to approve the request.

    Activities that have been proposed, but don't yet meet the Consesnsus requirements will have the status: `REQUIRES_CONSENSUS`. Activities in this state can be approved or rejected using the unique fingerprint generated when an Activity is created.
