# TurnkeyCrypto

This package provides a collection of cryptographic utilities used across our applications, particularly for working with keys, encryption, and decryption using Apple's CryptoKit and HPKE.

It includes support for:

* Generating and serializing P-256 key pairs
* Decrypting credential and export bundles (HPKE)
* Encrypting mnemonics into enclave-compatible bundles
* Verifying enclave signatures using ECDSA

These utilities are designed to work alongside Turnkeyâ€™s enclave-based infrastructure for secure key management and wallet recovery.
